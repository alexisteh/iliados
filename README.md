# iliados

Hello everyone! I built a social analysis and annotation app for the Iliad. 

Use the Perseus API hosted by Tufts University to load all 16000 lines of the Iliad, can be read in the 'Text' pane. 

- navigation: 
    - can type in line location 
        - look at Glaucus and Diomedes: 6.101 
    - next and back buttons 
    - click in box to go to part of book 
        - want to go to book 16/17, see the war.

- need to create an account to use the social features. 

- reading:
    - can go to any part of book 
    - click on text shows annotations 
    - if not logged in, cannot create annotations and save words 
    - If logged in, can create annotations and save words 
    - If logged in, can edit own annotations and unsave words 

- saved words

    - can drag words to list 
    - can view annotations from saved words page
